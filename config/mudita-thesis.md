# Mudita Investment Thesis

Use this document as the strategic thesis lens for thesis-fit decisions. Keep it concise and update over time.

## Decision Labels

- `[Hard]` Non-negotiable filter. Failure here usually means off-thesis.
- `[Strong Preference]` Important preference that can be outweighed by exceptional strengths.
- `[Nice]` Positive signal but not required.

## Core Pillars

- **[Hard] Proprietary Data Moat**  
  Company has clear evidence of a durable data advantage (exclusive or compounding data, proprietary labels/feedback loops, or model performance that improves with unique usage data).  
  Potential-only moat is not enough by itself.

- **[Hard] Workflow Enablement and Stickiness**  
  Product is embedded in high-frequency, business-critical workflows and becomes hard to replace over time.

- **[Hard] Founder Domain Depth**  
  Founders show direct domain understanding and execution credibility in the target market.

- **[Strong Preference] Scalable GTM Efficiency**  
  Evidence of repeatable go-to-market with realistic expansion and improving efficiency.

- **[Strong Preference] Platform Lock-In via APIs and Integration Surface**  
  APIs or integrations expose differentiated signals and create switching costs once implemented.

- **[Strong Preference] Capital Efficiency and Financial Discipline**  
  Company can operate with disciplined burn and has a plausible path to break-even if needed.

- **[Strong Preference] Short, Low-Friction Sales Cycles**  
  Prefer motions with faster time-to-value and lower procurement friction.
  Government and education-heavy cycles are generally less preferred.

## Dealbreakers

- **[Hard]** No plausible path to durable differentiation beyond features.
- **[Hard]** Mission-critical claims are unsupported by evidence or contradicted by customer/market signals.
- **[Hard]** Weak or generic founder-market fit with no compensating strengths.
- **[Hard]** Primary business model is B2C, consumer marketplace, or services-heavy delivery.
- **[Hard]** Hardware is a core dependency of value creation (software-led models preferred).
- **[Hard]** Blockchain is a major component of the offering

## Evidence Expectations

- **Data moat evidence:** proprietary data sources, feedback loops, measurable model improvement over time.
- **Workflow evidence:** usage frequency, retention/expansion, role-level embedding in daily operations.
- **Founder evidence:** relevant operator outcomes, domain credibility, execution track record.
- **GTM evidence:** target segment clarity, conversion and retention proof points, efficiency trajectory.
- **Financial evidence:** burn discipline, runway realism, path to sustainable unit economics.

## Evaluation Rules

- Missing generic diligence information (including incomplete financial detail) should **reduce confidence**, but should **not by itself** classify a company as mixed/off-thesis.
- "Why it might not be a fit" must reference a **direct conflict** with a core pillar or a hard dealbreaker.
- If no direct thesis conflict is found, classify as `on_thesis` or `mixed` based on evidence strength, not as `off_thesis`.
- Keep evidence gaps separate from thesis-conflict reasoning.

## Nice-to-Have Signals

- **[Nice]** Portfolio synergy with practical cross-sell or integration potential.
- **[Nice]** Positive societal impact aligned with mission.
- **[Nice]** Category timing tailwinds with clear urgency drivers.
- **[Nice]** Early evidence of pricing power.

## Out of Scope

- Opportunities driven mainly by short-lived feature novelty.
- Markets where the company cannot clearly articulate why now and why them with concrete evidence.

## Confidence Calibration Guidance

Use confidence as evidence quality, not enthusiasm:

- **80-100:** multiple concrete, recent evidence anchors support the conclusion.
- **60-79:** meaningful but partial evidence; some important gaps remain.
- **40-59:** mixed or weak evidence; conclusion is directional only.
- **0-39:** insufficient or contradictory evidence; do not over-assert fit.
